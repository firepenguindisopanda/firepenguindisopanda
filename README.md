### Philosophy

> "I pursue mastery through disciplined reasoning and real-world validation." - I consistently seek to ground my technical work in solid theoretical foundations while testing ideas in production-like environments. I value systems that are provably correct, observable in practice, and continuously refined through feedback and learning. Shipping software is more important than making it perfect.
